- supports [GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown)](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
- renders LaTeX-like formulae if they're surrounded by `$$`

## Downloads

... can be found at [releases](https://github.com/lx4r/markdownfox/releases)

## Known issues

- When using gedit only the first change to the Markdown file triggers an update of the preview in MarkdownFox. This doesn't seem to happen with other editors. [Issue regarding this bug](https://github.com/lx4r/markdownfox/issues/13)
